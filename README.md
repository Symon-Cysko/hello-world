# hello-world
Hi, Nick. How are you doing today? Good, I hope. Well this was a nice chat, but we'd best keep moving on, eh?

Hi, my name is Symon Cysko (as far as you need to know, at least). I'm a student programmer studying at a local community college. This hello-world project is for the course, aiming to introduce us novice programmers to the wonders of Github. Anyways, that's enough about me (for now). Read the DoFix Saga.
